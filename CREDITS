This is a well deserved, even if only partial, credits-file of people that have
contributed to the ESP project. Contributors are sorted by last name and the
fields are: name (N), email (E) and description (D) of their major
contributions.

Thank you, not only for the lines of code, but also for the endless
conversations that led to designing, implementing and debugging ESP.
I couldn't have done it alone.
